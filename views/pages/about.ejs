    <p>The purpose of my site is to assist in planning a trip. I'd like to include the weather at both the departure location and the arrival location.</br>
    I plan to have a calendar for checking on events during the trip, as well as deletion and modification of those events based on the weather.</br>
    Lastly, I would like to have something that either suggests or provides POI or Points of Interest possibly based on location.</p>
